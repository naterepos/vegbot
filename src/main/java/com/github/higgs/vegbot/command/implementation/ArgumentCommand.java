            "where other people used this same argument. In similarity to current animal rights, several countries previously had festivals involving the killing and eating of dogs. Many of these practices are " +
            "now banned, but the people at the time would tell you simply that it was their culture and therefore it was okay. You can also find this in more extreme examples like America's south during the civil war " +

            "In stark contrast to each of these qualities, killing someone who clearly does not want to die clearly does not fit the definition of humane. While euthanasia has decent reason to be moral, killing for flesh " +

However, this only partially covers the issue at hand. First, we need to understand that omega-3s come in many forms with focus on three: " +
            "alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaeonic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA and DHA are generally found in animal sources while ALA is found in plant sources.

This isn't considering that there are many other sources of ALA throughout the day such as walnuts, chia seeds, some vegetable oils, soy products, and much more.
